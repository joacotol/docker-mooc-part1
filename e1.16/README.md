This project is just a very simple static html page running on a container.

This will only need apache in order to run it.

Install apache 


Set your working directory to 

/usr/local/apache2/htdocs


Move or copy your html file to the working directory


Build the docker container 

Run the container with an exposed port (example port 80)

Go to localhost:80 or which ever port you exposed in your browser!
